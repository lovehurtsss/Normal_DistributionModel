# Modelling of normal Gaussian distribution 
*The code is written using С language in MATLAB*\

The code can build a normal distribution model in the form of 1d, 2d, 3d. Also animated to change variables

The normal distribution, also known as the Gaussian distribution, is one of the most important distributions in statistics. It describes a random variable that has values concentrated around a mean, with these values scattered with a certain degree of spread or standard deviation.

## Formula

The probability density function (PDF) for the normal distribution is given by the following formula:

x: This represents the random variable for which we are calculating the probability density. In the context of the normal distribution, 
x could represent any value from the distribution's domain.

μ: This is the mean of the distribution, also known as the expected value or the average. It represents the central tendency of the distribution, around which the values are concentrated.

σ: This is the variance of the distribution. It measures the spread or dispersion of the values around the mean. The square root of the variance,
σ, is known as the standard deviation, which gives a measure of how much the values deviate from the mean.

e: This represents the base of the natural logarithm, approximately equal to 2.71828. It's used in the formula because of the natural exponential function.
